        <h2>You're welcome too Mugman</h2>
        <p>
          On the fictional Inkwell Isle, Cuphead and his brother, Mugman, are
          two fun-loving cups who live under the watchful eye of Elder Kettle.
          Against the elder's warnings, the brothers enter the Devil's Casino
          and begin playing craps. When they go on a winning streak, the Devil
          himself offers to raise the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win one
          more roll, they will receive all the money in the casino; if not, the
          Devil will take their souls. Cuphead loses by rolling snake eyes, and
          he and Mugman beg for mercy. The Devil makes a deal with them: If the
          two can collect a "soul contract" from each of his runaway soul
          debtors by midnight the next day, he might let them keep theirs. They
          visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire
          blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest, but also warns them
          that the debtors may change physical form in an effort to stop them.
          The brothers travel around the Inkwell Isles,
